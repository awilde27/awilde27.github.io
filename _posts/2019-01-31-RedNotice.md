In Bill Browder’s Red Notice, an intriguing autobiography and Russian expose, a young
man discovers his heritage and becomes inspired to blaze a new trail, a trail much different than
those of his parents. Whether or not it was in his blood, Browder finds the Russian markets to be
his calling after becoming disillusioned by a conventional career in Consulting and Finance. I
believe that Browder’s most unique quality was his ability to overcome any sort of inhibition or
neuroticism that he may have had, and instead become a very engaging individual who took
initiative which eventually lead to great success.

Bill Browder is clearly a very smart guy, hailing from a family of academics and even an
infamous politician—his grandfather, the leader of the American Communist Party from 1930 to 1945. However, it was through his experiences growing up that he decided academia was not the
right choice for him, much to the dismay of his parents. When he graduated from the University
of Chicago with an economics degree, he might have seemed like your typical econ major
looking to go into a finance or consulting role. And he did. It is interesting to think about the fact
that Browder believed he did not want to follow in his family’s footsteps of being an academic,
yet he ended up picking a very common field of study. Almost a quarter of undergraduates at
UChicago declare economics. At a very early point in his life, it seemed as if he had a
psychological battle within: he wanted to make an impact and be unique, but how was he to
define what impact was to him? Browder certainly had a certain spark within him, and he
discovered it when he found out more about his grandfather, Earl Browder. Earl was the leader
of the Communist Party for 15 years. This was right before Joseph McCarthy began his famous
campaign, and it was clear that Earl Browder would be one of the first people he targeted. I am
not sure why Bill was so intrigued by his grandfather, but Earl was clearly a very brave man who
was anti-war and had strong beliefs. This must have led to Bill’s inspiration to quit his job as a
consultant and move to Russia.

Perhaps the most exciting part of Browder’s testimony is when he finally receives a job
offer at Salomon Brothers and begins his journey into Russia. His time in Russia while working
at Salomon Brothers was only the beginning, but it was clear that the intensity of being in such a
polar opposite country to the US or Britain was enough for Browder to fall in love. I am interested in why he was so certain that pursuing a career in the Russian markets was his calling,
as it was clear there was major evidence that his decision may have been heavily influenced by
his grandfather’s life. Nevertheless, he started slow and eventually made his way to quitting his
job and starting his own fund, a sign that Russia was a match. A question to ponder about his
experience early on was if the timing of entering Russia looking for investment was not as
perfect, would he have had a revelation that he would start up his own fund and stay put for
decades? While he surely had an emotional attraction to Russia, it also appeared very appealing
due to its highly volatile state and growth opportunities as it transitioned from communist to
capitalist and companies opened up to the public. A side note, what also flabbergasts me was that
even though it seemed like investing in Russia was so good it couldn’t be true (and it eventually
became close to not being true), the Russian public seemed totally oblivious to the potential
opportunities to make money. The government probably had a thing or two to do with this, but as
Browder stated in his book, he was surprised that no one else in Russia was thinking the same
way he was. Only a select few foreign investors even had a clue as to the lucrative upside in
companies which were heavily undervalued. I definitely feel somewhat sympathetic towards the
Russian public regarding this, as I believe the government does not easily allow for people to
realize financial opportunity in the country much less to capitalize on it. It was hard enough for
Browder, who had a buffer living in England and initial capital.

One of the things I admire about Browder is his conviction. Starting as a consultant after
college, he must have realized that clients should always be the main focus in a business deal and
he was true to his word. Although when he started Millenium Management he had billionaire
investors and viewed them differently from members of banks or smaller investors, he treated
everyone with the same respect, and always sought to ensure that their investments were well
worth it. This might have been due to the fact that he was nearly a one man show and had less
margin for error as a result, but he gained his investors’ trust and was very adept at pitching his
idea to clients. Another admirable trait is his resilience. Throughout the book Browder
illuminates the innate resilience of the Russian people, having gone through so much and been
subject to horrid abuse in wars and even by their own government. I truly think one of the
reasons that Browder was successful and stayed for so long was because he fed off of the
toughness of the people around him. He had no choice but to play hardball out in Russia, but it
was his interactions and experiences with people there that truly made him a warrior who was
fearless in confronting arguably the most scary, remorseless people in all of the world. The fact
that he decided to expose Putin and his loyal oligarchs at a time when they would stop at nothing
to ensure their power, influence and positions stayed intact for as long as they were alive still
leaves me in disbelief today.

Even though it is hard to empathize with a story such as Browder’s, who came to Russia
looking to get rich and make money off of the instability of the country’s infrastructure, it is
important to note that the ending to the story and the impact it had is much more important as we
move into the future. He fought for his own behalf, but also on the behalf of thousands of
Russians who were victims to the brutal dictatorship and the stranglehold it had and still has on
society. Browder’s fight for justice for Sergei Magnitsky was truly a courageous and fitting act,
and it was a great way to not only show integrity but also to show responsibility for the decision
that he made to start a company there in the first place. Ultimately, I believe that Bill Browder is
a great man who should always be remembered for his bravery in the face of tyrants that still get
away with terrible things, even in our world today.
