# Summary

The Square, Inc. investment pitch was a fully intensive company analysis and stock pitch for my Equity Research team, which was performed back in late November, 2017. The goal of the project was to perform a multi-faceted analysis into Square's 10-K report and other information found on the internet in order to perform a stock valuation on a four month timeline. The analysis consisted of:

* Key Events (November 2015-November 2017)
* Management Assessment
* Competitive Assessment
* Industry Analysis
* Risk Analysis
* Controversies
* Catalysts
* Valuation

In two weeks, our target price was accurately predicted to within 1.5% of the stock price at the time we pitched, at a return of 25.2%.
