Fourth year student at UC Berkeley studying Applied Math with a Data Science concentration. I am passionate about learning, and love building projects to test what I've learned. Favorite classes at Cal so far have been Math 55 (Discrete Math), Stat 134 (Probability), and CS 189 (Machine Learning).  

Through my past work, I have become interested in insight focused Data Science, particularly product-based Data Science, and Marketing & Business Analytics. My dream would be to join a company that has something to do with my personal interests outside of school and work.
